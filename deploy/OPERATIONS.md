# Production operations

Veritra supports one server process and one local data directory. The server
rejects a second writer with `.veritra-server.lock`. If startup reports a stale
lock after a hard crash, verify that no Veritra process uses the directory
before removing it.

## First setup and secret rotation

Set `PRIVATE_MESSENGER_ENV=production` and a high-entropy
`PRIVATE_MESSENGER_SETUP_TOKEN` in the root-readable environment file before
the first start. Complete owner setup, remove the token, and restart. A fresh
production database fails closed without the token; an initialized database no
longer needs or retains this one-time capability.

Rotate the owner password through the authenticated client. For offline owner
recovery, stop the server and use `reset-owner-password --account ...
--password-file ...` with a mode-0600 password file. Rotating VAPID keys
requires clients to register new push subscriptions; never place private keys
in command arguments or logs.

## Upgrade and rollback

1. Run a completed backup and copy its whole directory off-host.
2. Stop the service and verify the server process exited.
3. Install the pinned release artifact or container, then start one replica.
4. Require `/readyz` to return 200 before sending traffic.
5. If rollback crosses an incompatible migration, stop the server, restore the
   matching pre-upgrade backup, and reinstall its matching binary.

Shutdown marks `/readyz` unavailable first, closes realtime connections, lets
active HTTP uploads finish within the server's 25-second shutdown deadline,
and then closes storage. Clients recover missed realtime events through durable
sync.

## Off-host restore drill

Run `messenger-server backup /secure-staging/veritra-YYYYMMDD`, then copy the
completed directory to separately controlled off-host storage. Never copy its
temporary sibling. On a clean drill host with an empty data directory:

```sh
messenger-server restore /mnt/off-host/veritra-YYYYMMDD
messenger-server doctor
messenger-server serve
```

Verify `/readyz`, owner login, conversation metadata, and encrypted attachment
download authorization. Do not inspect or log ciphertext bodies during the
drill. Destroy the isolated drill data according to the operator's retention
policy after recording the date and result.
